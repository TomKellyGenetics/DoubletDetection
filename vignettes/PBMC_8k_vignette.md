## Install packages

### Install package:


```r
if(!require(devtools)){
  install.packages("devtools") # If not already installed
}
#> Loading required package: devtools
devtools::install_github("TomKellyGenetics/DoubletDetection", ref = "r-implementation")
#> Skipping install of 'DoubletDetection' from a github remote, the SHA1 (2f420ba5) has not changed since last install.
#>   Use `force = TRUE` to force installation
```

### Install dependancies:







```r
#devtools::install_github("JinmiaoChenLab/Rphenograph")
devtools::install_github("TomKellyGenetics/Rphenograph")
install.packages("hdf5r")
install.packages("Matrix")
```

### Install hdf5 (if needed)

OS X (using Homebrew)	`brew install hdf5`

Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu)	`sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev`

Systems supporting yum and RPMs	`sudo yum install hdf5-devel`

HDF5 1.8.14 has been pre-compiled for Windows and is available at https://github.com/mannau/h5-libwin 

### load package (and dependancies)


```r
library("DoubletDetection")
#> Loading required package: Matrix
#> Loading required package: Rphenograph
#> Loading required package: gplots
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'gplots'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     lowess
#> Loading required package: Rtsne
#> Warning: replacing previous import 'Matrix::cov2cor' by 'stats::cov2cor'
#> when loading 'DoubletDetection'
#> Warning: replacing previous import 'Matrix::toeplitz' by 'stats::toeplitz'
#> when loading 'DoubletDetection'
#> Warning: replacing previous import 'gplots::lowess' by 'stats::lowess' when
#> loading 'DoubletDetection'
#> Warning: replacing previous import 'Matrix::update' by 'stats::update' when
#> loading 'DoubletDetection'
```

## Download Data from 10X Genomics

These commands will be called from R in Linux and Mac systems. The files will need to be downloaded from the given url (into the working directory) in Windows.


```r
#download files
if(!(file.exists("pbmc8k_filtered_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz"))){
  system("wget http://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/cell-exp/2.1.0/pbmc8k/pbmc8k_filtered_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz")
  #extract compressed files 
  #system("tar -xvzf pbmc8k_filtered_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz")
}
```

## Load Counts Matrix


```r
matrix_path <- 'filtered_gene_bc_matrices/GRCh38/matrix.mtx'
raw_counts <- DoubletDetection::load_mtx(matrix_path)
# Remove columns with all 0s
non_zero_genes <- apply(raw_counts, 1, function(x) sum(x) != 0)
raw_counts <- raw_counts[non_zero_genes, ]
```

## Run Doublet Detection

Right now, phenograph is a bit talkative, so we suppress the output to avoid lots of text:
